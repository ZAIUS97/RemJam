# RemJam

## What is RemJam?

I have put together an ArchLinux based image that has been setup to include quick IOC/ malware analysis/ reverse engineering tools in a disposable container format.

Tools include:
- Radare2 w/r2ghidra addon installed
- CAPA
- JARM
- FLOSS
- YarGen
- NeoVim
- Wget
- Curl

Also Included:
- CAPA Test Files
- FLOSS Test Files

Remjam Pure = without test files
